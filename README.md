# Subscriber-Count

This project is a simple page with a YouTube subscriber count.

The page works with a JS Script that will get the infos from the API of Youtube, using :

- Your YouTube channel's Id
- Your Google API Key

The links to find these informations are in commentaries in the API.js file.
